.. note::

    The Boilerplate ships pre-configured and runs out of the box if the :doc:`installation` steps are followed

The CMS allows for custom style sets within the editor. This ables the user to choose certain presets or colours. We
already added the general Bootstrap utilities for you. The file can be found at:
``/static/js/addons/ckeditor.wysiwyg.js``.
